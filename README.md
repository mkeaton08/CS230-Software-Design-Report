# Gaming-Room-Software-Design-Doc

# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a company that developed the Android game Draw It or Lose It and wanted to expand it into a web-based game that could run on multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, and web browsers. The software needed to handle multiple users simultaneously and be scalable for future growth, potentially supporting gaming consoles like Xbox and PS4.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I created clear and organized documentation that effectively communicated both technical details and client requirements. I ensured that the architectural design was scalable, focusing on server-client communication, database management, and multi-platform compatibility, making the game adaptable to various devices.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the design document gave me a clear roadmap before starting to code. By outlining the architecture and breaking down each component, I was able to better visualize the software's structure. This made it easier to collaborate with team members and reduced the chances of misunderstanding requirements or objectives.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the section of development requirements. In each section of operatinf systems (OS) Mac, Linux, Windows, and Mobile, I would provide more details about each OS. PRoviding a sentence or two does not cover the full details about each OS. Discussing each OS more in depth will help give a better understanding of each OS.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Considering user needs is essential because a product's success depends on how well it meets user expectations. If the game is difficult to use or performs poorly, it will negatively impact user engagement. A user-focused design leads to higher satisfaction and increased player retention. Focusing on understanding the client's desire for a cross-platform game that provided a smooth and intuitive experience for players. By designing with scalability and platform compatibility in mind, I ensured the game would meet user expectations, such as fast load times and seamless interaction across devices.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I used an iterative design approach, refining the requirements through feedback from the client. I applied modular design principles to make the architecture scalable and adaptable for future changes. In future projects, I would incorporate more prototyping tools earlier in the design phase to better visualize the end product and improve communication.
